My school is settin��g up a new network with bothe Macs and Apple II's.  I'm
used to ethernet, and don't know mu�ch about LocalTalk.  Two things:  first,
in MacWherehouse, bthe�y have PowerUser network connectors, and the caption
leads you to bel��ieve that you can plug them into the phone lines in the
building and have them work.  Is this true?  I've seen it done by running
sep�erate phone cords, but never with real lines.  Second, if that does work,
could you use a modem �hooked up to that same line while the network was
active?  Help would be greatly appriciated.  BTW-��running seperate phone line 
is out of the question, the network wil  VERRY spread o.
